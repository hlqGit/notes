# notes
All of my notes from classes I've taken, created with typst.  
(PDFs of the notes are also available in the notes folder as well.)

## Noteworthy Template:
I used the [noteworthy](https://typst.app/universe/package/noteworthy) template from typst for the majority of my notes. I modified it a bit to fit my use case better, so the template I use can be found in the templates folder.
